Server Metrics Dashboard
This project is a real-time dashboard for visualizing server metrics, including uptime, CPU load, and memory usage, from simulated servers. The data is collected using Zabbix, processed with Python, and displayed through an interactive dashboard.

Technologies Used
Python: For backend logic, data processing, and integration with Zabbix.
Zabbix: To collect server metrics.
Docker: To simulate the servers as containers.
Dash: For building the interactive web-based frontend dashboard.
Flask (optional): Can be used if needed for routing or serving static pages in conjunction with Dash.

Setup and Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
2. Install Python Dependencies
Use pip to install the required Python packages. It’s recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing dependencies:

bash
Copiar código
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Zabbix Server
You can either use an existing Zabbix server or set up your own. Follow these steps to set it up in a Docker container:

Start Zabbix Server
bash
Copiar código
cd containers
docker-compose up -d
Configure Zabbix
Ensure the Zabbix server is running properly by checking the Zabbix web interface (usually accessible at http://localhost:8080).
Set up hosts (simulated servers/containers) in Zabbix to start collecting data. You can use the create_hosts.py script or manually configure them through the Zabbix interface.
4. Configure Zabbix Integration in Python
Edit the backend/config.py file to include your Zabbix server's credentials and any other required configuration settings, such as:

python
Copiar código
ZABBIX_API_URL = "http://localhost/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php"
ZABBIX_USERNAME = "Admin"
ZABBIX_PASSWORD = "zabbix"
5. Run the Application
Start the Backend
You can run the backend (Python/Dash app) by executing the following:

bash
Copiar código
cd backend
python app.py
This will start the Dash app and it should be accessible via http://localhost:8050.

Start the Frontend
If you're using Dash for the frontend, the app.py file will automatically serve the dashboard. Otherwise, if you're using Flask, make sure the server is running and serving the correct templates.

6. Docker Configuration (Optional)
To run everything in containers, make sure the following files are set up:

Dockerfile: Defines the Python environment.
docker-compose.yml: Defines all the services (e.g., backend, Zabbix).
To start the containers with Docker Compose:

bash
Copiar código
docker-compose up --build
This will set up both the backend and Zabbix server in containers.

7. Test the Application
Ensure the application is running smoothly by running the tests:

bash
Copiar código
pytest tests/
Usage
Once the application is set up and running, you can view the server metrics in real-time on the interactive dashboard. The data includes:

Uptime: How long the simulated servers have been running.
CPU Load: The CPU load percentage of each server.
Memory Usage: The memory utilization on the servers.
You can filter and customize the dashboard using the provided controls to get more detailed views or change the time range.
